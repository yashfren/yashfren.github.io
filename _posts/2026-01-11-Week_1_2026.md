## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week

### 2. HTB Academy

Finished the first module - Injection Attacks , on HTB Academy.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 1 of internship done. Just doing some training now.

### 4. Coding

Yeah the HTB module - Injection Attacks kicked my ass. I need to learn python for automated exploitation.

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Didn't touch this as I was too busy.

### 6. Bug Bounty

No time at all for this.

### 7. Additional learning

Hit some new PRs at the gym and I will try listening to audiobooks in the gym from tomorrow to multitask.

## Conclusion:

This stuff is no less overwhelming than before but it does seem a lot more fun. Learning is fun and whenever I learn something new, this feeling of dread in my mind is gone. 

Next week I will try to do more and even start learning coding then.
