description: 6 topics left until Portswigger is done for good
---

This week I finished GraphQL API vulnerabilities, Server Side Template Injection and Web cache poisoning on portswigger. 

## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 2. HTB Academy

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 7 of internship done.

### 4. Coding

Literally no time. 

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Finished GraphQL API vulnerabilities, Server Side Template Injection and Web cache poisoning and published walkthroughs for all 3 on the blog.

### 6. Bug Bounty

Still no time at all for this. Still totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

I didn't do anything extra.

## Conclusion:

This week I was locked in. But I feel bored doing just portswigger everyday tbh.
