## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because my laptop died.

### 2. HTB Academy

Finished the second module for CWEE - Intro to NoSQL Injection , on HTB Academy. Note taking is pending because laptop dead.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 2 of internship done. Just doing some more training.

### 4. Coding

The HTB module - Intro to NoSQL Injection kicked my ass as well. I REALLY need to learn python for automated exploitation.

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Didn't touch this as I was too busy. Plus laptop dead.

### 6. Bug Bounty

No time at all for this. Totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

Learnt some C++. The playlist I am using is 7 videos, I finished the first video.

## Conclusion:

Bro my laptop battery is dead. I am posting this a day early as I have to go to another city tomorrow (internship/work). I will be back next week after my trip. Will get my laptop fixed when I am back.
