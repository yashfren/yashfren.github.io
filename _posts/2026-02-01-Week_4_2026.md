description: Start of BSCP Prep
---

This week i started doing Portswigger again. My goal is to clear the BSCP ASAP.

## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 2. HTB Academy

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 4 of internship done. Not much work this week. I had a lot of free time. This will change from next week sadly :( lol.

### 4. Coding

Literally no time. 

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Finished CSRF and CORS and published walkthrough for it on the blog.

### 6. Bug Bounty

Still no time at all for this. Still totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

I watched 2 lectures from Theory of Computation from MIT OCW. Oh and I hit new PRs at the gym, feelsgoodman.

## Conclusion:

I gotta speedrun portswigger, build notes and clear BSCP ASAP.
