description: Finishing Client Side vulnerabilities and more
---

This week I finished Client Side vulnerabilities on portswigger. 

## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 2. HTB Academy

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 5 of internship done.

### 4. Coding

Literally no time. 

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Finished Clickjacking, DOM based vulnerabilities and WebSockets and published walkthrough for it on the blog.

### 6. Bug Bounty

Still no time at all for this. Still totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

I had a busy week overall with work, study and other commitments so no time for extra stuff.

## Conclusion:

I will try to finish all portswigger labs by end of this month hopefully.
