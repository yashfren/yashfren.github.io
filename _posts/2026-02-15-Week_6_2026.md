This week I finished Insecure Deserialiation and Web LLM Attacks on portswigger. 

## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 2. HTB Academy

Didn't touch it this week because BSCP Prep.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 6 of internship done.

### 4. Coding

Literally no time. 

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Finished Insecure Deserialization and Web LLM Attacks and published walkthrough for it on the blog.

### 6. Bug Bounty

Still no time at all for this. Still totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

I didn't do anything extra.

## Conclusion:
