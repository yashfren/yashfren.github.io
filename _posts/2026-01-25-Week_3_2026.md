## Stuff I did

### 1. Pentesterlab

Didn't touch it this week because I was out + no time.

### 2. HTB Academy

Didn't touch it this week because I was out + no time.

### 3. Job/Internship

Week 3 of internship done. Went to meet my colleagues to another city for half the week.

### 4. Coding

Literally no time.

### 5. Portswigger Academy

Finished making notes for all server side topics.

### 6. Bug Bounty

Still no time at all for this. Totally fucked.

### 7. Additional learning

I attended my first local HackTheBox meetup on saturday. That was cool. 

## Conclusion:

Laptop is finally fixed. I really need to lock the fuck in.
