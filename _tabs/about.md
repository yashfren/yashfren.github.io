Hi, my name is Yash and I am interested in red teaming and penetration testing. As of writing this i.e. July 2025, I am waiting for my CPTS result, and I plan on consistently sharing my journey weekwise for the OSCP. Feel free to reach out to me via linkedin or twitter (more active here, share daily updates about my learnings).
